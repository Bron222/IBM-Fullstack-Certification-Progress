# Notes for 01 Intro Software Engineering

## âœ… Topics Covered
- [x] Software Engineer vs. Developer
- [x] SDLC
- [x] Building Quality Software

## Notes
- Engineer focuses more on design aspects, larger picture
- Developer focuses on feature management


- SDLC phases: 1. Planning 2. Design 3. Development 4. Testing 5. Deloyment 6. Maintenance
- Planning: requirement are gathered, analyzed, documented, prioritized. 
  - May produce prototypes to get requirements. 
  - Create the Software Requirements Specification (SRS document).
- Design: software architecture is developed and reviewed. 
  - Prototypes can be disigned. 
  - Design document created.
- Development: Start coding process using design document.
- Testing: Code is tested for stability, security, and meets requirements from the SRS. 
  - Bugs are reported, tracked, fixed.
- Deployment: launched to production environement users.
  - user acceptance testing (UAT).
  - after sign-off of customer, it is released to production.
- Maintenance: support, fix other bugs, code enhancements, new or change requirements, feedback.

- system requirements are classified:
  - Functional
  - external & user interface
  - system features
  - nonfunctioanl
 
- Quality code attributes:
  - Maintainability
  - Readability
  - Testability
  - Security
  - Well documented, clean and consistent, effiecent, without defects, follows coding standards
  - use linters to dected errors

- Testing:
  - Unit testing: testing small snippet of code
  - Integration test: testing that unit when merged with product
  - UAT or Beta testing

- Releases:
  - Alpha: first functioning version, may contain errors, design changes may occur, select stakeholders
  - Beta: all stakeholders, user testing, meets requirements
  - General Availability: Stable, all users
 
- Documenting:
  - system docs - explains how the system works, maintenance, README files, inline comments, arch and design, (technical documents)
  - User docs - user guides, instructional vids, manuals, online and inline help (non tech docs)
