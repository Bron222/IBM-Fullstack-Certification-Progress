- Developer focuses on feature management
- SDLC phases: 1. Planning 2. Design 3. Development 4. Testing 5. Deloyment 6. Maintenance
- Planning: requirement are gathered, analyzed, documented, prioritized. 
  - May produce prototypes to get requirements. 
  - Create the Software Requirements Specification (SRS document).
- Design: software architecture is developed and reviewed. 
  - Prototypes can be disigned. 
  - Design document created.
- Development: Start coding process using design document.
- Testing: Code is tested for stability, security, and meets requirements from the SRS. 
  - Bugs are reported, tracked, fixed.
- Deployment: launched to production environement users.
  - user acceptance testing (UAT).
  - after sign-off of customer, it is released to production.
