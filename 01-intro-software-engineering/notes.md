## âœ… Topics Covered
- [x] Software Engineer vs. Developer
- [x] SDLC
- [x] Building Quality Software

## Notes
- Engineer focuses more on design aspects, larger picture
- Developer focuses on feature management
- SDLC phases: 1. Planning 2. Design 3. Development 4. Testing 5. Deloyment 6. Maintenance
- 1) Planning: requirement are gathered, analyzed, documented, prioritized. 
  - May produce prototypes to get requirements. 
  - Create the Software Requirements Specification (SRS document).
- 2) Design: software architecture is developed and reviewed. 
  - Prototypes can be disigned. 
  - Design document created.
- 3) Development: Start coding process using design document.
- 4) Testing: Code is tested for stability, security, and meets requirements from the SRS. 
  - Bugs are reported, tracked, fixed.
- 5) Deployment: launched to production environement users.
  - user acceptance testing (UAT).
  - after sign-off of customer, it is released to production.
- 6) Maintenance: support, fix other bugs, code enhancements, new or change requirements, feedback.
