# Notes

## Webpage basics
- HTML - format / page structure
- CSS - flare / style
- JavaScript - interactivity and dynamic content

- Static vs Dynamic
 - Static - websites whose elements are stored (or previously stored) on the server
 - dynamic - generated each time they are requested by the client. can involve information from other systems and app like DBs
 - most websites have elements of both

- CLoud apps
 - similar to websites, request content that a server returns
 - build to work seamlessly with a cloud-based back-end infrastructure
 - contain cloud-based data storage and data processing, and other cloud services, making them scalable and resilient

- Front-end: what the client see and interacts with. HTML, CSS, JS, related frameworks/tools
- back-end: deal with the server before the code and data are sent to the client, handles the logic and funct. and authentication processes that keep data secure, back-end dev also work with DBs
- Full stack do both environments

- Tools
  - code editor
  - IDE (integrated dev enviornment)
  - IDE integrates with management and storage like GitHub
 
## Front-End Dev
- HTML
- CSS
- JS - OOP language
- SASS - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets: An extension of CSS that is compatible with all versions of CSS, enable you to use things like variable, nested rules, inline imports to keep things organized
- SASS allows you to create style sheets faster and more easily
- Learner Style Sheers (LESS): enhances CSS, adding more styles and functions, backwards compatible with CSS
  - Less.js is a JS tool that converts the LESS styles to CSS styles
 
 Reactive or adaptive websites display the version of the website designed for a specific screen size.
- A website can provide more info if opened on a PC than when opened on a mobile device

- Responsive Design of a website means that it will auto resize to the device.
- will change sizes to the screen and still show you all the features

#### JS Frameworks
  - Angular Framework - open-source framework by Google. Allows websites to render HTML pages quickly and effeciently
    - built in tools for routing and form validation
  - React.js - by Facebook, is a JS library that builds and renders components for a web page
    - routing is not a part of this framework and will need to be added by 3rd party tool.
  - Vue.js - by community, focus is the view layer which includes user interface, buttons, visual components
    - flexible, scalable, and integrates well with other frameworks.
    - very adaptable - it can be a library, or it can be a framework

## Back-End Dev
- creates and managees resources needed to respond to client requests
- enables serves infra. to process requests, supply data and provide other services securely
