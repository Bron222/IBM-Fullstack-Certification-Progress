# Notes for Mod 2: Web and Cloud Development

## âœ… Topics Covered
- [x] Interpreted and Compiled Languages
- [x] High lang vs low lang
- [x] database lang




# Notes

## Programming Language
- interpreted Lang
  - scripting lang.
  - operates through interpreter on comp or browser
  - ex: JS, Python, Lua (game scripting), HTML
- Compiled Lang
  - programs are packaged/compiled into 1 executable file, usually larger, often used locally on a computer
  - programming lang
  - run faster and more repeatablyi
  - ex: C, C++, C#, Java

- High level langs
  - more sophisticated
  - common English
  - ex: SQL (Structured Query Language), Pascal, Python

- Low level langs
  - more sophisticated
  - used simple symbols to represent machine code (0s and 1s)
  - assembly: closely tied to CPU architecture; each CPU type has its own assembly lang
  - ex: ARM, MIPS, X86
  - simple readable format, entered one line at a time, one statement per line
  - {label} mnemonic {operand list} {;comment}
  - mov TOTAL, 212
  - assembly translated by an assembler using mnemonics like: input (INP) output (OUT) load (LDA) store (STA) add (ADD)

- Query Lang
   - request send to a database 
   - SQL, AQL, CQL datalog, DMX
   - CRUD: create read update delete

 - NoSQL
    - (Not Only SQL) a non-relational DB, whereas SQL is relational

 - query statements
    - select, where, order by, update, insert into, alter table, create, drop, sum, count, avg
    - SELECT * FROM table_name;

## CODE ORGANIZATION METHODS
- organizing code: Pseudocode vs Flowcharts
    - FlowChart programs include: Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, Draw.io, DrawAnywhere
