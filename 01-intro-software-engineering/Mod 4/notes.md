# Notes

## Software Architecture and Design
- why is it important?
    - communication, earliest deign decisions, flexibility, increases lifespan
 
- software deign is a process to document:
    - structural compenents
    - behavioral attributes - describes what the system does, but not how - UMLs can do this (state transition diagram and interaction diagram)
- expressed using diagrams/flowcharts/UML
- structural elements: modules and sub modules
    - cohesive and loosely coupled
        - cohesive: all funtionally related elements are grouped together
        - loosely coupled: modules are weakly associated so changes in one have minimal effect on others

- Unified Modeling Language (UML): visual representations to communicate arch, design, and implementation
    - can be structural or behavioral
    - programming language agnostic
    - advantages: plans, comunicates, saves time/money, bring team up to speed quickly, navigate source code
