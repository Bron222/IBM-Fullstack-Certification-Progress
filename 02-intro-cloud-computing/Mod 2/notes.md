# Notes for section 2 mod 2: Overview of Cloud Service Models

## 3 Service Models
- MODELS: from most complex to least complex
- IaaS - Infrastucture services - users: system/IT admin
- Paas - services from infrastructure - users: developer
- Saas - software host over internet - users: everyone

- Car Metaphor
  - IaaS: leasing - pay for the gas, care about the specs, color, and details
  - PaaS: renting - don't care about specs, but still paying for the gas
  - SaaS: taxi - don't care about the details, you're not driving, don't pay gas
